    <p>Recently, a new approach for studying the electronic problem of a 1-D Fibonacci quasicrystal was proposed based on transfer matrix method. The method relies on computing the trace of the transfer matrix in terms of a new set of self-similar polynomials, a quasiperiodic generalization of the Chebyshev polynomials. In this paper, we show how the method can be applied to solve for six-cycle self-similar wave functions.</p>
